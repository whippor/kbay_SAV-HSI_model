# Kasitsna Bay Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Habitat Suitability Index Model

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a repository under active development to model habitat suitability indices (HSI) for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) including canopy kelp, understorey kelp, and seagrass in Kachemak Bay, Alaska.

### Objectives

-   Create a validated habitat suitability index model for major SAV categories in Kachemak Bay.

-   Provide publicly available data to identify critical SAV types and locations.

### Guiding Questions

-   What is the theoretical total area that canopy kelps, understorey kelps, and seagrass could colonize in the bay?

-   How do HSI values align with past and present observations of seagrass and kelp?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Running The Code

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once cloned, the code can by run piecemeal for each SAV group using the **\*HSI_runall.R** code blocks. Alternatively, you can run all the models using the **32_HSI_runall.R** code block.

## Methods

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Collection

Existing datasets for Kachemak Bay were identified for the current model and synthesized to provide bathymetry, substrate type, and SAV presence (canopy kelps, seagrass) layers.

### Bathymetry

Bathymetry data were generated by Martin Renner from: NOAA’s National Geophysical Data Center Kachemak Bay DEM for tsunami modeling (NOAA 2010); NOAA essential fish habitat smooth sheets (curated by Mark Zimmerman, NMFS), and GMRTv4.2 (2024). Grids were produced by reprojecting and bi-cubically up-sampling each existing grid where appropriate, and manually filling in all missing values. Some irregularities and artifacts are expected at the boundaries between coverages. Visual inspections were performed to address some issues, but others likely remain.

### Substrate Type

Substrate type data were taken from NCEI archives as a thematic map of benthic habitat classification in Kachemak Bay created by multibeam echosounder data, automated image processing techniques, and on-screen editing (NOAA 2020).

### SAV Presence

Both kelp and seagrass presence data were extracted from the AOOS Workspace and included kelp cover polygons of Kachemak Bay for 2000-2002, and seagrass polygons from [????].
