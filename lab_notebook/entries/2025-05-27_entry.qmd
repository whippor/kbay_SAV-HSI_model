## Objective

To use the 'presence' data sets for canopy and seagrass as a method for validating the model outputs.

## Method

New scripts for canopy and seagrass were created in the validation code folders.

Full HSI models minus presence layers were added.

Presence was then overlaid and a scale for performance was created from -1 to 1, with -1 being underprediction by the model and 1 being overprediction by the model. 0 indicated perfect agreement.

## Results

Both models had high levels of joint-absence overlap. Removing the overlap greatly decreased the model's accuracy.

## Notes

The seagrass model may be underpredicting because of inaccurate substrate values, or inaccurate TAM values. Consider increasing TAM values of seagrass for gravel/cobble substrate.
